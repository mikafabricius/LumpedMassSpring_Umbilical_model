# LumpedMassSpring_Umbilical_model
Matlab code for an LMS umbilical model, with spherical bound nodes for linkage of segments. Using fourth-order Runge-Kutta and secant method for finding solution numerically.

% Give model parameters, cositing of umbilical parameters, simulation parameters and model paraters like the amount of nodes.
