# LumpedMassSpring_Umbilical_model
Matlab code for an LMS umbilical model, with spherical bound nodes for linkage of segments. Using fourth-order Runge-Kutta and secant method for finding solution numerically.

# MATLAB file contains

- Detailed comments for explanation
- Detailed explanation of the equation of motion for each node
- Clever use and navigation of 3 dimensional matrices in MATLAB
- Secant method for prediction step
- Runge-Kutta method
- Plots for visualization of umbilical dynamics

Examples of plots:

% Give model parameters, cosisting of umbilical parameters, simulation parameters and model parameters e.g. the amount of nodes.

% work in progress
